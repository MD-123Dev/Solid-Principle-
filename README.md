# Solid-Principle-
Solid Principle with TypeScript

# Defintion : 

 - S : Single-responsiblity Principle => Every Class should have a single job to do and should only one reason to change a class .
 - O : Open-closed Principle =>  Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.( it means that we make an interface that contains functions and each class becomes implements from it and modifier )
 - L : Liskov Substitution Principle => LSP states that in an object-oriented program, if we substitute a superclass object reference with an object of any of its subclasses, the program should not break.
 - I : Interface Segregation Principle => A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.( it means Each Interface is specialized in one thing and the functions in it are related only to its specialization ) .
 - D : It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.( that means there should be a inetermediary between them ).
